# Quantum Neural Network Workshop

### Date: April 28, 2025
### Venue: Rosenheimer Straße 143 c, 81671 München
### Target Audience
This workshop is designed for researchers, engineers, and executives interested in quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML). Familiarity with linear algebra and Python programming is recommended for following the theoretical and technical aspects. Attendees are expected to have preliminary experience with basic quantum computing theory already.
### Workshop Objectives
Understand the fundamental principles of quantum neural networks (QNNs).
Implement and train simple QNNs using Qiskit.
Explore current research trends and enterprise challenges in QNNs.
Evaluate quantum readiness and return on investment (ROI) for organizations.
